# n-steps

Took the Python solution from the the code problem "N-Steps" from dailycodeproblem.com and 
converted it to a node console application. Was a bit tricky due to the lack of support for native python 
range() and sum(). Features use of ES6 array features including spread.

Use:
$bash node main
